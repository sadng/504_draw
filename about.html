    <p1>
        Draw map created for the University of Hawai'i Hilo Crack Team, working in tandem with the United States Geological Survey - Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (USGS-HVO).
        This map application will collect line and point data when in the flow fields.
    </p1>
    <p1>
        When using the line tool, mark three points. The first line leveling pole, the measurement device, and the second line leveling pole.
        Feel free to also use the point tool if preferred. Please continue by inputting measurement data into the form and pressing submit.
        A measurement line tool was also provided for use as deemed necessary.
